1. Go to your Factorio saves folder (on Windows, defaults to `%AppData%/Factorio` (put this in an Explorer window & it'll correctly navigate you to the folder).
2. Pull down this repo as *its own folder inside of the Factorio saves folder.* Factorio recognizes folders by default, the folder name will show up in your saves list.
3. Load the save like normal (remember, you'll find the name of the folder & navigate to the individual save).
4. Make sure you push your saves!
